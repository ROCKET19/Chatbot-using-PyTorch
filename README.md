		-- torch
		-- numpy
		-- nltk
		-- from model import NeuralNet
		-- from nltk_utils import bag_of_words, tokenize
		-- socket
		-- import torch.nn as nn
		-- from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
		
3 --> if any changes are made to the 'pattern' and 'responses' in the intents.json dataset. Then execute the train.py file to train the model (change the hyperparameters according to the need).
